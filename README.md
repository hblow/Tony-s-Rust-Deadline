Background:
A challenge set upon my friend Tony to help teach him coding basics with an actual project. I am making an attempt for fun too and to learn the Rust language.

Rules: 
Using AI in this process is ILLEGAL
All else is fair game(except straight copy pasting the game from somewhere, make pong from scratch)

GOAL: Finish basic pong in Rust in a week, ie. by Tuesday, September 23, 2025 11:29 PM MDT
